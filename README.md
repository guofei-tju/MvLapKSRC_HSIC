# MvLapKSRC_HSIC

The MvLapKSRC_HISC contains two folders, the folder SupplementaryTables is the support material of the experiment, in which SupplementaryTable1 stores the parameters of the cross species experiment, and SupplementaryTable2 stores the comparison between our model and other models in the cross-species experiment. MvLapKSRC_HISC-master is the code of the experiment to identify DNA N4 methylation sites, where main_mv.py and main_crossSpecies.py are the main functions, representing multi-view experiment on a single species and multi-view experiment across species, respectively.
